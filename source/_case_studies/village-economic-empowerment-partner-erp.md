##The Problem
Our Client, Village Economic Empowerment(VEE) needed a way to manage and share data and information with their partners. 

For VEE, this needed to happen both in realtime and after field work was completed. The platform needed to be secure as well as accessible while on the go.

##The Solution
To have an efficient, user friendly and secure system, we dived right into research. We tried to find out how (at the time) everything was being done and how technology can be used to improve the process. 

At the end of the research we built a web application with the following features:-
1. Handle a large number of multimedia files which could be streamed through the platform.
2. A realtime application which notifies users in case of information updates.
3. A user friendly application which can be accessed via both mobile devices and computers.
4. A web application which can handle information and multimedia securely.
